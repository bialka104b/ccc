                    I love chelsea because it is the best soccer team ever and I really like them becuase they wear the blue
                        kit(Thats mine favourite color).I have been supporting this team for a while now and I hope the team stays on track and gets alot of wins.
                        This team has alot of amazing players and has a great hystory.They have won alot of the matches but also lost some.
